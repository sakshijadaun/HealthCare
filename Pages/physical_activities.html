            <h1>Physical Exercises</h1>
            <p>Exercise is crucial for older Seniors, but it can be hard to know where to begin. If you haven’t worked out for a while, re-entry into the active world can be daunting. There’s also a good chance the exercises you were once accustomed to aren’t ideal for older adults.
               Before you launch into an exercise regimen, it’s important to check with a physician to ensure you’re healthy enough for exercise, and to see which exercises are ideal for your current fitness level </p>

                <h2><li>Water aerobics</li></h2>
                <div class="content">
                <span class="e1">In the past years, water aerobics have become an extremely popular form of exercise among all ages, but in particular to seniors. Exercising in the water is ideal for those living with  arthritis and other forms of joint pain, as the buoyancy of the water puts less stress on your joints. Additionally, water brings natural resistance, which eliminates the need for weights in strength training. Water aerobics exercises improve your strength, flexibility, and balance with minimal stress on your body.</span>

                <div class="content">

                <h2><li>Walking</li></h2>
                <div class="content">
                    <span class="e1">One of the least stressful and accessible forms of exercise is walking. For some seniors, walking is a bigger challenge than others, so distance and step goals differ from person to person. For the general population, 10,000 steps per day is advised for a healthy lifestyle, but those with difficulty walking or joint pain may settle for a smaller number as a goal. A PLOS One study found that walking 10,000 steps lowered the ten-year outlook for mortality by 46%. Walking promotes a healthy lifestyle, while strengthening muscles, lowering your risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and colon cancer.</span>

                <h1>Mental Exercises</h1>
                <p>Exercising your mind is important at all ages. The brain is made up of many specialized areas and nearly 100 billion neurons. If not used consistently, the brain can become atrophied. Brain atrophy essentially destroys neurons and the connections that help cells communicate. Mental exercises help stimulate the brain and sharpen thinking, memory, reasoning, and processing skills. According to scientists, seniors can gain an additional 14 years of “cognitive youth” by practicing mental exercises.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <span class="e1">Gardening is a popular pastime for many elderly individuals. It acts as an effective physical activity, keeping seniors active and mobile. Gardening is a great calming and wellness activity for seniors to participate in, as it has been found to reduce the stress hormone cortisol.

There is also a strong link between gardening and reducing the risks of dementia.</span>
