        <h1>Healthy Eating</h1>
        <p class="font">As you get older, itâ€™s important you continue to eat well. Changes in your body result in lower energy (calorie) requirements. It is therefore important to reduce portion sizes if activity is low, and to cut down on sugary snacks such as cakes and buns.</p>
